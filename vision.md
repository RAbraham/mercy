# Can Datalog be the Future of Programming

I have a dream. My product owner asks for anything and I finish it in two hours. Naive? Perhaps. But it has fuelled my programming growth over the last decade.

Alan Kay first inspired that dream by talking about DSLs and how they could reduce the required lines of code drastically. That started a quest for a DSL for mainstream systems(CRUD?). Gradually, I saw smart people talking about data more than code(RA: Entity Component Systems, the problem with OOP). Do we have a DSL for data? Yes, we do. SQL! which was arguably the most successful DSL in our history.  

RA: Dedalus inspired chip programming
RA: Bashlog
