Welcome to Mercylog 
============================

Mercylog is a library in Python for relational programming. It is currently a work in progress and not meant to be used in production or staging or development or anywhere.

It is inspired by Datalog and its inspirations.

Its additions to standard Datalog will be:
- adding time explicitly to relations (inspired by [Dedalus](http://www.neilconway.org/docs/dedalus_dl2.pdf))


Benefits:
- reducing code size by atleast 50%([Overlog](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1755913.1755937), [Yedalog](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43462.pdf)).
