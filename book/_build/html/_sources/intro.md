Welcome to Mercylog 
============================

Mercylog is a library in Python for relational programming.

It is inspired by Datalog and its inspirations.

Its additions to standard Datalog are:
- adding time explicitly to relations (inspired by [Dedalus](http://www.neilconway.org/docs/dedalus_dl2.pdf))


Benefits:
- reducing code size by atleast 50%([Overlog](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1755913.1755937), [Yedalog](https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-data/pdf/43462.pdf)).
