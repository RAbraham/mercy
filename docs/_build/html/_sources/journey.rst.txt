Inspiration
^^^^^^^^^^^

* I got inspired about DSL's by Alan Kay. I was on a constant search for DSLs. I think some way down that path, I learned about declarative languages and Prolog, leading me to know about Datalog.
* I first wanted to build Datalog over Hadoop. And found Cascalog(a Clojure over Hadoop). It seems defunct now and do not go their site! It's taken over and bombarded with SEO text.

* Read about AI and Prolog initiatives. Got a sense that it would not scale.
* Read ML at scale by Borkar and how Datalog was a natural fit for ML. This got me really interested in Datalog.
* Read about Dyna for AI (suggested by David Barbour). The creativity of using Datalog for AI and Analytics hit me hard. It's like my mind was pried open.

* Saw the Dedalus video by Peter Alvaro on Strangeloop. I first heard about Dedalus from David Barbour of Awelon Blue. He mentioned that it was one of the promising systems for writing good code.
* Read the Boom Analytics paper. Got excited about the order of magnitude reduction in code size with Overlog.
* Read the Dedalus paper in part. Got excited about the idea of declaratively specifying time and space in addition to computation.
* Read the MLog paper. My mind started churning. MLog talks about iteration with time steps. Dedalus is about state in time steps. Can they both be combined?
* Read the differential dataflow work by Frank McSherry. Got excited about having a runtime for Dedalus.
